# x402-Agent Framework Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the x402-Agent Framework - the first autonomous AI agent system with built-in micropayment capabilities.

## 🚀 What is x402-Agent Framework?

The x402-Agent Framework enables AI agents to autonomously pay for API access, tools, and services using cryptocurrency micropayments. When an agent encounters an HTTP 402 "Payment Required" response, it automatically processes the payment and continues with the task - no human intervention required.

### Key Features

- **🤖 Autonomous Payments**: Agents handle micropayments automatically
- **💳 HTTP 402 Integration**: Seamless payment processing for APIs
- **🔗 Multi-Agent Swarms**: Collaborative agents with cost-splitting
- **📦 Payment Batching**: Efficient transaction bundling
- **🌐 Multi-Blockchain**: Support for Base, Solana, and Ethereum networks
- **📊 Built-in Analytics**: Comprehensive spending and performance tracking

## 🎯 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
pip install x402-agent
```

### 2. Basic Agent

```python
from x402_agent import X402Agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Create agent
agent = X402Agent(
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4"),
    wallet_key="your_private_key",
    network="base"
)

# Register API tool
agent.register_tool(
    name="weather",
    endpoint="https://api.weather.com/v1/current",
    description="Get weather data"
)

# Run task with automatic payments
result = agent.run("What's the weather in San Francisco?")
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Collaboration

```python
from x402_agent.swarm import AgentSwarm

# Create swarm
swarm = AgentSwarm(shared_wallet=True)
swarm.add_agent(researcher, "researcher")
swarm.add_agent(analyst, "analyst")

# Collaborate on task
result = swarm.collaborate(
    "Research AI developments and create analysis report",
    strategy="sequential"
)
```

## 🔧 Core Components

### X402Agent
The main agent class that orchestrates LLM interactions, payment processing, and tool execution.

### WalletManager
Handles cryptocurrency wallet operations across multiple blockchain networks with secure key management.

### PaymentProcessor
Processes HTTP 402 responses, manages payment batching, and handles transaction retries.

### AgentSwarm
Coordinates multiple agents for collaborative tasks with automatic cost-splitting and resource sharing.

### ToolRegistry
Manages API tool registration, discovery, and execution with automatic payment integration.

### Monitoring
Provides comprehensive analytics, performance tracking, and real-time alerting capabilities.

## 💡 Key Concepts

### HTTP 402 Payment Required
The framework leverages the HTTP 402 status code to enable seamless API monetization. When an agent encounters a 402 response, it automatically:

1. Parses payment requirements from response headers
2. Validates payment amount and recipient
3. Processes cryptocurrency payment
4. Retries the original request with payment proof

### Deferred Payment Batching
To optimize gas costs, payments can be batched together:

- Multiple API calls accumulate pending payments
- Batch processing occurs when threshold is reached
- Single blockchain transaction handles multiple payments
- Significant gas cost savings for high-frequency usage

### Multi-Agent Coordination
Agents can collaborate on complex tasks:

- **Parallel**: All agents work simultaneously
- **Sequential**: Agents work in order, building on previous results
- **Divide & Conquer**: Task split into subtasks for different agents

## 📊 Token Economics

### Native X402 Token (Coming Soon!)

The x402-Agent ecosystem will be powered by the native X402 utility token:

- **Governance**: Protocol upgrades and parameter changes
- **Staking**: Rewards for API providers and infrastructure operators
- **Premium Features**: Advanced analytics and enterprise capabilities
- **Marketplace**: Agent and tool marketplace transactions

**Contract Address**: Coming Soon! 🚀

Stay tuned for the official token launch announcement on our community channels.

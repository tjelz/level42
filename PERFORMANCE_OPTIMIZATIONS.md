# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Major Issues Fixed

### 1. WebGL Shader Performance (LaserFlow Component)
- **Reduced DPR**: Lowered device pixel ratio from 2.0 to 0.75 for better performance
- **Frame Skipping**: Implemented frame skipping (render every other frame) to reduce GPU load
- **Shader Complexity**: Reduced FOG_OCTAVES from 5 to 3 and TAP_RADIUS from 6 to 4
- **Animation Speed**: Reduced animation speeds by 50% to lower computational load
- **Target FPS**: Set target FPS to 30 instead of 60 for mobile/low-end devices

### 2. CSS Animation Optimizations
- **Grid Background**: Increased grid size from 50px to 100px, slowed animation from 20s to 40s
- **Floating Particles**: Simplified animation, reduced opacity, removed rotation transforms
- **Breathing Animation**: Removed scale transforms, kept only opacity changes
- **Added will-change**: Added will-change properties to optimize GPU acceleration

### 3. DOM Manipulation Reduction
- **ElectricBorder**: Throttled ResizeObserver updates to 100ms intervals
- **ScrollTypewriter**: Throttled scroll events to ~60fps (16ms intervals)
- **Conditional Rendering**: Made floating particles conditional on mount state

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- **PerformanceMonitor**: Added real-time FPS and memory usage monitoring (Ctrl+Shift+P)
- **PerformanceWrapper**: Added intersection observer to pause animations when not visible
- **Visibility API**: Pause animations when tab is not active

### 5. Global Performance Improvements
- **CSS Optimizations**: Added global performance CSS rules
- **Reduced Motion**: Added support for users who prefer reduced motion
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Added transform3d and backface-visibility optimizations

## Performance Parameters Adjusted

### LaserFlow Component
- `wispDensity`: 1.2 → 0.8
- `flowSpeed`: 0.4 → 0.2
- `fogIntensity`: 0.8 → 0.4
- `wispSpeed`: 12.0 → 8.0
- `wispIntensity`: 6.0 → 4.0
- `flowStrength`: 0.3 → 0.2
- `fogFallSpeed`: 0.8 → 0.4
- `dpr`: auto → 0.75

### CSS Animations
- Grid animation: 20s → 40s
- Particle animation: 8s → 12s
- Breathing animation: 4s → 6s

## Expected Performance Improvements

1. **FPS**: Should increase from low FPS to stable 30+ FPS
2. **Memory Usage**: Reduced by ~30-40% due to lower resolution rendering
3. **CPU Usage**: Reduced by ~50% due to frame skipping and simplified animations
4. **GPU Usage**: Reduced by ~60% due to shader optimizations and lower DPR
5. **Battery Life**: Improved on mobile devices due to overall reduced computational load

## Monitoring Performance

Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` to toggle the performance monitor that shows:
- Real-time FPS counter
- Memory usage (if available)
- Color-coded performance indicators:
  - Green: Good performance (30+ FPS, <100MB memory)
  - Yellow: Moderate performance (20-30 FPS, 100-200MB memory)
  - Red: Poor performance (<20 FPS, >200MB memory)

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Further Optimizations**: If performance is still poor, consider:
   - Reducing LaserFlow `dpr` to 0.5
   - Disabling LaserFlow entirely on mobile devices
   - Using static images instead of animations for low-end devices

2. **Browser-Specific**: 
   - Chrome: Should see best performance
   - Safari: May need additional WebGL optimizations
   - Firefox: Consider reducing shader complexity further

3. **Device-Specific**:
   - Mobile: Consider detecting mobile devices and applying more aggressive optimizations
   - Low-end devices: Implement device capability detection
